How to compile: $: make
How to run: $: ./game

Upon Game Startup, a main menu will be displayed which displays the title, 
controls, how to quit and how to start playing. Once the game has started
use the ',' key to move left, and the '.' key to move right. The SPACE key
is used to fire rockets. Fire rockets to destroy the saucers of the form 
'<--->' before they escape the screen and to defeat destroyers before they
destroy your defenses.

Destroyer:
	  _______________
	 <_______________>

Press 'Q' to quit at any time.
Upon Defeat, either by too many saucers escaping, or by destroyed defenses,
the game will pause and display a message. Press 'Q' to exit.

** Code Structure

main.c:
=======
the main function

** Threads
Main thread: 
is the game loop, and is reserved for input handling.

rocketThreads: 
each rocketThread is meant for an individual rocket, which
is shot by the users cannon when the space key is pressed. This thread
moves the rocket structure along a coordinate path and updates the screen
for each frame.

saucerSetup:
saucer setup is thread that splits off from the main immediately and generates
the new saucers. It does so by sleeping for random intervals between each 
saucer creation.

sThread: 
sThreads are the threads for the default saucers. Each saucer has it's own
thread. These threads are responsible for initializing the saucer's struct,
altering the saucer's coordinates, and updating the screen after each frame.

destroyerThread:
The destroyer thread is reserved for the improved saucers, which do not leave
the screen and attack back. Much like sThread, destroyerThread is responsible
for a single saucer, it initializes the structure, alters the coordinates, and
updates the screen. Also destroyerThreads create a second thread for each of
the destroyer's rockets.

destroyerRocketThread:
Much like the regulare rocketThread, the destroyerRocketThread is meant for 
and individual rocket. It initializes the structure, updates the coordinates,
and displays it to the screen.

collisionThread:
This thread is used to iterate through each live rocket and live saucer and
check if they are occupying the same coordinates at any given time. If 
they are then a collision has occured and the appropriate flags are raised.

destCollisionThread:
This thread is much like the collisionThread, except it checks if a destroyer
rocket has collided with a user cannon. When a collision occurs, the 
appropriate flags are raised and the game displays an end-game message.

gameMonitor:
gameMonitor is seperate thread that constantly checks the state of the game.
If a game ending flag is raised it properly stops all the background operations
pauses the output. It also displays the end-game messages.

** Critical Sections

Each time a call to curses is made it must be in a critical section of code.
So in each module that has an animate function there is at least one critical
section of code that makes calls to curses which is monitored by a mutex lock.
There is also a lock for the number of escaped saucers as that shared variable 
is used in several places. 

There are several shared resources that are not monitored because I felt that
it was not necessary to lock down each shared resource. I locked the ones that 
I knew needed to be, because if they weren't they could lead to odd outputs, or
deadlocks. v
